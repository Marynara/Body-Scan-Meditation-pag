 <p> You’ve probably heard all about the benefits of meditation and mindfulness. But getting started can feel overwhelming with so many types of meditation to choose from.
With the body scan method, you can become more mindful of your bodily sensations. This knowledge can then make it easier to address what’s wrong physically and emotionally, leading to improved wellness in body and mind.</p>
